# Connect-Four
The Challenge from Global Hack Week (MLH)
Task: 
Recreate the classic game - Connect Four. If you’re new to coding, we recommend keeping it simple. If you’ve been hacking a while, consider challenging yourself more by attempting it in a new language or without googling any questions. Connect with us and show it off on the Devpost!
